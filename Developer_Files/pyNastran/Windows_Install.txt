To use pyNastran on Windows, consider the following notes:

PyNastran GUI for Windows
-------------------------
Although you may download and use python, this is not necessary if you want to directly use the pyNastran GUI on Windows.
You may directly download an EXE file from SourceForge. Double check that you are downloading the latest file (which may not be from the green button).
https://sourceforge.net/projects/pynastran/files/?source=navbar

Also note that the main pyNastran page is here, which links to SourceForge to download the GUI

PyNastran Converter for Windows (ABAQUS to NASTRAN)
---------------------------------------------------
Within pyNastran, there is a smart converter for an ABAQUS/CacluliX INP deck to a NASTRAN/MYSTRAN BDF/DAT deck.
It is more than just a simple node/element converter and it is able to convert and link properties, materials, loads, and boundary conditions.

To use the converter, you need to run command line pyNastran. To do so, first download python. Note that GUI EXE (as discussed above) contains python within it.
https://www.python.org/

Next, you need to determine the location of pip.exe. In one case, it was located here:
C:\Users\Computer\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python310\Scripts

Using a command window set to this path, type "pip install pyNastran" (see also https://pynastran-git.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/installation.html)
This will pull pyNastran from a database? and install it.

The command line "Format_converter" can be used.



PyNastran (General) for Windows
-------------------------------
For the general installation, first download python. Note that GUI EXE (as discussed above) contains python within it.
https://www.python.org/

Next, you need to determine the location of pip.exe. In one case, it was located here:
C:\Users\Computer\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python310\Scripts

Using a command window set to this path, type "pip install pyNastran" (see also https://pynastran-git.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/installation.html)
This will pull pyNastran from a database? and install it.

If you now run pyNastranGUI from a command line (while the path is set correctly), it will request PyQT5/6 or PySide2/6.
You will also need to install VTK.
Neither one of these options has been explored for Windows (but you can use the prebuilt pyNastran GUI instead).
