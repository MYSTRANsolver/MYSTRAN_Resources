# Collection of problems with AUTOSPC

## Coaxial bar elements

In Mystran, this model doesn't solve and the .F06 file ends with:

 `*ERROR  9903: SUPERLU SPARSE SOLVER HAS FAILED WITH INFO =            4 IN SUBR SYM_MAT_DECOMP_SUPRLU CALLED BY SUBR LINK3`

It does solve in Comlab and MSC Nastrans.


3 coaxial CBAR elements along the x axis
DOFs 123 constrained at the left end
Force in x direction at the right end

```
       +------+------+------+ --> F
      123
```

The "correct solution" is x displacements of the 3 unconstrained nodes and zero y and z displacement of all nodes.

Results from different solvers:
- Mystran: No solution, no constraints generated by AUTOSPC.
- MSC: Correct solution, waiting for results from 2025_05_23_1143 AUTOSPC_bar_2.zip.
- Comlab: Correct solution, no constraints generated by AUTOSPC.
- Mecway: Correct solutionn, no constraints generated by any AUTOSPC equivalent.
- CalculiX: Correct solution


Conclusion:
Mystran's AUTOSPC is behaving the same as Comlab's and MSC's AUTOSPC but something else, probably the matrix solver is not tolerant of rigid body modes whereas it is for the other solvers.
It might not matter that it doesn't solve because you should be constraining all 6 degrees of freedom of the structure.
