FEX is a lightweight program (only 2MB) that can read and interrogate BDF files.
It can be used to visually show the model, discover issues, measure, and perform various other operations.
It has a built in tutorial and low learning curve. I found this to be a simple tool that is quite useful. It does not have post processing capabilities.
