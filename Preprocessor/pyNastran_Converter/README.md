This converter is a portion of pyNastran and has been compiled as an EXE.
It has the ability to convert a complete deck.
For example, it can convert an ABAQUS/CalculiX INP to a NASTRAN/MYSTRAN BDF (including the ability to convert nodes, elements, materials, properties, loads, boundary conditions, and link them all together).
This is unlike the basic node/element ABAQUS to NASTRAN converter also found in this repository.
