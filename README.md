# MYSTRAN_Resources

This repository contains files related to the main MYSTRAN project here: [MYSTRAN](https://github.com/MYSTRANsolver/MYSTRAN)

The MYSTRAN_Development folder is a catch all for all files that are not source code or end user documentation (those are located in the main repository linked above).

The Preprocessor and Postprocessor folders contain files related to pre/post processing related to the MYSTRAN project (and by extension NASTRAN as well).
